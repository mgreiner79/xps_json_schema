# xps_json_schema
 A working draft of the schema for uploading XPS data.
 The schema is intended to be an information model for X-ray Photoemission Spectroscopy Data. It includes classes for spectra, data sets, samples, and instruments. Much of the model has been adapted from the VAMAS file format (BS ISO 14976-1988), but has excluded parts pf the standard that fall outside of the scope of XPS data.
This schema will be implemented in the initial release of the SpectroscopyHub service (spectroscopyhub.com).
